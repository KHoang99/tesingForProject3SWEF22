# Project 3 - Dyno-Discordance - Code for Getting Player Achievements

I tried creating a test.js executable to run the Steam API, but had issues with printing out the JSON file or it seems that way.
I first attempted to create a discord bot and implement it that way, but it was unsuccessful. I removed a lot of code because they weren't doing too much to help.
test.js is the main file executable. 
config.json holds "important" keys
SteamAPI.js is supposed to hold a class for the steam commands
