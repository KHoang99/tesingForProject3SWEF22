//Requirement 3: As a gamer, it would be cool to have a notification when I hit x hours in a game.

//--Task 1--
//Implement connection from plugin to steam

//From here, the code from task one now should allow the user to link steam to the plugin

//--Task 2--
//Implement connection to specific steam user database in order to gather hours on the game
//the user is currently playing.

//Assuming that the user is able to log in, the plugin will now connect to the user specific database where it can access
//the users current game they are playing along with the hours they have achieved in the game so far.

//--Task 3--
//Create a data structure that can then store and update hours on game title

//Now that we have access to the steam database, assuming that the user is logged in, 
//we can now create a datastructure to hold the users steam info, most importantly in this case
//the current game the user is playing along with the total game hours played.

//--Task 4--
//Counter function that keeps track of every increment of 10 hours reached in a game through the steam database

countGameHours() 
{
    if (totalHours % 10==0)
    {
        bool incremented = true;
        sendGameHours(incremented,totalHours);
        incremented = false; //sets bool value back to false, to reset counter
        return 0;
    }
    else
    {
        break;
    }
    return 0;
}

//The following function would be an example on how the program would count the incremented.
//The function checks to see if the total game hours have incremented by 10.
//If they have, the function then calls the sendGameHours function to send a notification to the user
//on their 10 hour increment.

//Without the function to check the incrementation, the program would not be able to check to see
//when to send a notification to the user on their playtime, and as a user that wants to be able to keep
//track of the playtime, it is crucial that the plugin has this feature.

//--Task 5--
//Implement ability for the plugin to send the user a notification when the 10 hour increment has been reached, 
//along with total hours in the specific game.

//Now that the program has the ability to check when to send a notification,
//this task code will be implementing the visual and backend portion of the process of sending the notification.
