STUFF TO KNOW:
How Steam Web API works
How Discord API works
What JSON, XML, and VDF is


Road Blocks:
Working with Java
Learning to connect tables/arrays to get the correct information

/*****************************************************************************************/

/* TASK #1: Establish connection between Discord and Steam */
// Establish the connection between Discord and Steam

// From Discord, connect to discord and user login to get the information connected


/*****************************************************************************************/

/* MAIN TASK TO SHOW */
/* TASK #2: Create a data structure for storing the achievements in, for each game. */

// Using Steam Web API, I have to use 'GetOwnedGames', which returns a list of the owned
// games for the user. Store that list into an array of games and then use
// 'GetPlayerAchievements', which returns a list of achievements
// for the user for a game, and with the owned games already known I can do a FOR Loop
// going thru the arr[games] to do an IF Loop to get the UNLOCKED Achievements from the
// game and place that into an array for achievements

// Returns a list of owned games: appID, gameName, playtime, etc, but we want to just
// store the appID and potentially the gameName with it.
// GetOwnedGames(steamID, ...);

// Will return a list of achievements for a game, we want to do a FOR Loop and an IF Loop
// to get the unlocked achievements of each owned game 
// GetPlayerAchievements(userID, appID);
// This returns a list, which also includes an '.achieved' result which can be used to
// figure out which achievements are unlocked for each game

/* Psuedocode to get and store the achievements for each game into an array */

// Example only: can look like this
for(int i = 0; i < games; i++)
{
	arr1[allAchievements] = Steam achievements	//store the achievements into an array
}


// I'll be using a for loop and an if/else statement to determine if the achievement was 
// unlocked and store that into an array for unlocked achievements


/* Psuedocode for the FOR Loop and IF/ELSE Statement */

for(int i = 0; i < ; i++)	// Cylcles thru the games
{
	if (arr1[achievements] == true)	// arr1[achievements] is the achievement
	{
		store achievement into arr2[unlockedAchievements]
	
	}
	"else"			// Doesn't need to be written out unless you want a statement
					// printed out
		achievement locked, so not put into array

}

// An issue, I ran into was trying to figure out how to get the correct achievements for each
// game, and having tables linked like in SQL.


/*****************************************************************************************/

/* TASK #3: Convert the achievements into string values to be printed */


/*****************************************************************************************/

/* TASK #4: Print out the achievements for each game into the Discord chat */

for(int i = 0; i < achievements; i++)
{
	printout: Game name
	printout: arr2[unlockedAchievements];
}

Roadblock:
// I can see an issue with printing out the game name and keeping the right # of achievements to it
// this is just a quick visual though, so it can definitely be easier than the thought process
